In this project i made my first portfolio.
This was a very challenging project and i struggled, but I completed all parts of it.
I first started out with my portfolio and got all of my pictures into it.
i made my nav bar next and made sure all of the buttons worked.
I then made a form so people could contact me.
My about page was by far the easiest and it looks very good and works well.
